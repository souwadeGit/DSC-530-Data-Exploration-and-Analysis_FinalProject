Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)
The report consists of female genital mutilation (FGM). I think this is an interesting topic with a large dataset under "Tableau Community Forums," but I am going to limit my analysis to some areas. The data of female genital mutilation (FGM) are under UNICEF(United Nations International Children's Fund) website.
